## How To Use It?
1. Open the mobi or epub ebook in Calibre Library
2. Convert it to HTMLZ
3. Extract the archive
4. Add the scripts to the bottom of the html document as shown in example.html
5. Open the html ebook in a web browser
6. Ctrl + A to select all
7. Copy and paste it into a Supermemo item
8. Right click on the item, select "Reading", then "Split", then "Split Article"
9. Uncheck all, except split based on horizontal line
10. Split

Done! In a few minutes you've prepared an ebook for incremental reading vs 20 minutes to do it manually.
